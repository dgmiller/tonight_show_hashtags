THIS WEEK :

    Kolten :
        . POS patterns
        . implementation maybe?

    Derek:
        ?

    Megan :
        . Polarity what tools? 
        . GBRT


    Natalie :
        . Polarity what tools?  
        . Naive Beyes

GOALS :
    . by (start of semsester) have all three methods running test with our data

ROADMAP: 

    / gather data
        X make web streamer
        X make web scraper
            . update web streamer for 24/7 with autostart

    . test harness

    / features
        X tag word with tagger from twitter
        . POS patterns
            . research how to do it.
            . make implementation
        . polarity
            . research tools that are out there
            . add polarity to data
        . other?

    / Naive Beyes
        / understand how they work (Nat. Der.)
        / make implementation (Nat. Der.)
        . implement for our data
        . fine tune


    . GBRT
        . understand how they work
        . make implementation
        . implement for our data
        . fine tune

    . SVM
        . understand how they work
        . make implementation
        . implement for our data
        . fine tune

    future :
        . auto categorize type of hashtag, choose best setup
        . paper

KEY:
    . = todo
    / = partially done
    X = complete
